# CMT307-Coursework
This coursework consists of a portfolio divided into two parts with equal weight:
- Part (1) consists of selected homework similar to the one handed in
throughout the course. The final deliverable consists of a single PDF file,
which may include reflective answers to theoretical exercises, snippets of
Python code and solved exercises.
- Part (2) consists of a machine learning project where students implement a
basic machine learning algorithm for solving a given task. The deliverable is a
zip file with the code, and a written summary (up to 1200 words) describing
solutions, design choices and a reflection on the main challenges faced during
development.

How to run in Linux:

1.Download IMDB.ipynb and IMDb to local

2.open terminal

3.type "pipenv shell"

4.type "pipenv install jupyter"

5.pipenv install numpy,nltk,sklearn,and every necessary module

6.type "pipenv run jupyter notebook"

7.open IMDB.ipynb in the jupyter notebook

The python code for section 2 runs using Python 3 so will require that or anything more up to dat to fully experience the code. Once downloaded it can be viewed in a jupyter notebook.
